## Status

A good portion of the hardware design is complete. The panel design is complete and most of the conponent selection is done. The panel board has a little bit of work with regards to spacing and vertical alignment, but is otherwise complete. The mainboard still has a bit of layout work to do to be able to fit everything in with a minimum of interference. There is still a decent amount of work there and prototyping to do. 

[You can see what I'm probably working on in Jira](https://nw2sdevices.atlassian.net/secure/RapidBoard.jspa?rapidView=2&projectKey=B2). Since this is a very small team, it doesn't get updated as often as it shoudld, but it will give you an idea of some of the recent accomplishments and near-future tasks. If you aren't familiar with a Kanban board, that is technically how I'm working through the tasks. 

## Licensing
The nw2s::b2/dsp is an open source project. Both the hardware and the software are released as open-source. 

This project builds on many contributors and is open source so that I can give back to the community. Most of them are unknowing contributors, so I've attempted to give credit wherever possible. Code, samples, algorithms, ideas: many of them are gleaned or borrowed, others are built upon. Still others are completely original. 

In the spirit of open-source, I ask that any use of these materials be properly credited and used in accordance with the applicable licenses. If you are not familiar with the common terms of open-source, I ask that you do a little research. Different parts of the project are licensed differently, depending on what it is. 

For the most part, all nw2s::b2/dsp code is licensed with GPL v3. GPL is a restrictive open source license. The gist is that you have access to the code for your own use. You may modify the source code, but you must release the modified source code. GPL also requires that all code that links to the nw2s::b2/dsp code must also be released as open source. This means that if you use any of this code in a project, your project must also be open source. 

With a few exceptions, the documentation and reference materials have been released as Creative Commons Attribution Share Alike. This means that you're free to create new works based on this documentation as long as you give attribution and also share the source material. 

The hardware is open-sourced as well. This is important. There are not many truly open-source hardware projects out there. All of the hardware design is my own and I am sharing it with the community. The hardware is licensed via the CERN OHL v1.2. This means that you are free to modify and even sell derivative works, however all source materials must remain open-sourced as well under the same license. Unfortunately due to the type of project, these are not trivial to source nor trivial to build. Fortunately for you, I don't really make that much money on them.
